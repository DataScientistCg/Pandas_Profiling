# Pandas Profiling

Pandas Profiling is a Python tool for generating detailed profiling reports of pandas DataFrames, including statistics and visualizations. This tool helps in quickly analyzing the data by providing an overview of the dataset, missing values, correlations, and much more.

## Installation

Before you can use this tool, ensure that you have Python installed on your system. You will also need to install the required libraries.

1. **Install Dependencies:**

   You can install the required packages using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas ydata-profiling
   ```

## Usage

To generate a profiling report of your dataset, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Your Data:**
   Ensure that your dataset (e.g., `housing.csv`) is in the correct directory, or update the code with the correct file path.

2. **Run the Script:**

   You can use the following Python script to generate the profile report for your dataset:

   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   from ydata_profiling import ProfileReport

   # Correct path for the CSV file
   df = pd.read_csv(r"C:\path\to\your\housing.csv")

   # Create ProfileReport
   profile = ProfileReport(df)

   # Save the profile report as an HTML file
   profile.to_file(output_file="housing.html")
   ```

   This will create a `housing.html` file containing a detailed profile of your dataset.

## Output

The output will be an HTML file that provides detailed information such as:

- Overview of the dataset
- Summary statistics (mean, median, mode, etc.)
- Missing values
- Correlation between features
- Visualizations for distribution and relationships of data
